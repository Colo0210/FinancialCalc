# FinancialCalc
 This project really is pretty simple. It helped bridge the gap between theoretical and implementaiton for the lessons we learned in class. Such as establishing variables, prompting user for information, and breaking down actions step by step for the computer to be able to complete tasks. With this week it being completing calculations. This shows you, how while it may take a while to complete writing this program, now that its complete if I ever need any of these calculations I can just run the program instead of having to do the math every time. With the three project being included below

One line of code that I do find interesting is on line 30 of cdvalue. Where i) is a char. In the second part of a loop, that char will be implicitly converted to a bool, to become the value of the loop continuation condition. Which is sometimes needed as certain calculations can only be done with specific methods.

I also have a screenshot of my homescreen below
